## Why This Guide?

!!! question "Confused About Data Careers?"

    **"I want to work with data, but which role is right for me?"**
    
    **"What's the difference between a Data Engineer and Data Scientist?"**
    
    **"What do these people actually DO all day?"**

If you've asked these questions, you're not alone. The data industry has exploded with new roles, and the boundaries between them are blurry. Every company defines these roles differently.

**This guide solves that problem.**

## How This Guide Works

### :material-lightbulb: Learn the Fundamentals

Start by understanding what data really means in tech. We'll trace a simple book purchase through an entire data system, showing you the 7 stages of the data lifecycle and the undercurrents that make everything work.

[Start Learning →](fundamentals/what-is-data.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

### :material-code-braces: Build Real Projects

Don't just read about data roles—**experience them**. You'll build a complete e-commerce analytics platform called "BookStore Analytics":

- **Data pipelines** in Apache Airflow (Data Engineer)
- **Clean data models** with dbt (Analytics Engineer)  
- **SQL analysis** answering business questions (Data Analyst)
- **Interactive dashboards** in Looker Studio (BI Engineer)
- **ML models** for recommendations and churn prediction (Data Scientist)
- **Production APIs** deploying models (ML Engineer)
- **Monitoring systems** ensuring quality (MLOps Engineer)

...and more across all 20 roles.

### :material-account-search: Discover Your Role

Through hands-on exercises, you'll discover which work resonates with you. Do you love transforming messy data? Building dashboards? Training ML models? You'll know by the end.
