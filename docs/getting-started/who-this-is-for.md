## Prerequisites

### What You Need

**Technical:**

- ✅ Basic computer literacy (file management, web browsing)
- ✅ Ability to install software
- ✅ Willingness to learn command-line basics
- ✅ Comfort with troubleshooting (googling errors!)

**Personal:**

- ✅ Curiosity about how things work

- ✅ Comfort with not understanding everything immediately

**Resources:**

- ✅ A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

- ✅ ~15GB free disk space

### What You DON'T Need

- ❌ Programming experience (we teach you)
- ❌ Statistics or mathematics degree
- ❌ Previous data experience
- ❌ Expensive tools or software

!!! success "Start Where You Are"
    If you can follow written instructions and aren't afraid of trying new things, you can do this. We build up knowledge gradually, explaining everything along the way.

## This Guide Might NOT Be Right If...

Let's be honest about limitations:

### ❌ You Want Deep Expertise in One Tool

**The issue:**

This guide introduces many tools but doesn't deeply cover any single one. If you want to become a Pandas expert or master Spark, you'll need specialised courses.

**Alternative:**

Use this guide to identify which role interests you, then pursue tool-specific courses for that role.

---

### ❌ You Want Video Tutorials

**The issue:**

This guide is entirely text and code-based. There are no video walkthroughs.

**Why:**

Written tutorials are more accessible, easier to follow at your own pace, and better for quick reference. But if you strongly prefer video learning, this might not suit your style.

---

### ❌ You Need Immediate Job Placement

**The issue:**

This guide doesn't guarantee job placement or provide direct employer connections. It's an educational resource, not a recruitment service.

**What it does provide:**

Skills, knowledge, and portfolio projects that will help you in job searches—but you'll need to apply and interview independently.

---

### ❌ You're Only Interested in One Specific Role

**The issue:**

This guide's strength is breadth—showing you many roles. If you're 100% certain you want to be a Data Scientist and nothing else, you might prefer a specialised Data Science course.

**However:**

Even if you're set on one role, understanding adjacent roles makes you a better collaborator and helps you verify that role is truly right for you.

---

### ❌ You Want Quick, Surface-Level Learning

**The issue:**

The hands-on projects require real time investment. You'll write actual code, build actual systems, and troubleshoot actual errors.

**Time commitment:**

- Reading all role pages: 3-4 hours
- Complete hands-on project: 15-20 hours
- If you're not willing to invest that time, you won't get the full benefit

## Common Questions

### "I'm not very technical—is this too advanced?"

**No!** We assume zero prior coding experience. We teach you everything you need, step-by-step. Yes, you'll feel confused at times—that's normal and expected. Learning data work means getting comfortable with temporary confusion.

### "I'm already a developer—will this be too basic?"

**Parts will be.** You'll breeze through setup and basic Python. But you'll still learn data-specific concepts, tools (Airflow, dbt, Snowflake), and how data teams operate. Focus on the new-to-you sections.

### "I don't have much time—can I do this in bits?"

**Absolutely.** Each tutorial is self-contained. Do one per week if that suits you. The knowledge is cumulative but you can take breaks between sections.

### "Do I need a maths or statistics background?"

**Not required.** We explain statistical concepts when needed, and the ML sections use beginner-friendly algorithms. If you're comfortable with basic algebra (which we rarely use), you're fine.

### "Will this help me get a job?"

**It will help, but it's not sufficient alone.** You'll gain:

- Understanding of roles (helps target applications)
- Practical skills (helps pass interviews)
- Portfolio projects (helps stand out)
- Knowledge of tools (helps meet job requirements)

But you'll still need to apply to jobs, network, prepare for interviews, and potentially do additional learning for your target role.

### "Is this guide kept up-to-date?"

**Yes, it's actively maintained.** Data tools and roles evolve, so this guide is updated regularly. It's also open-source—if you spot outdated info, you can suggest updates.

### "Can I do this on Windows? Mac? Linux?"

**All three work.** Instructions are provided for all major operating systems. Some commands differ slightly, but we note those differences.
